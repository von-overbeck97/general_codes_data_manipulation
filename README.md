# general_codes_data_manipulation

## This is how I combine differrent tables together and also search for IDs. sqlite was used when the conditions for ID search are complex. Feel free to refer and use the code to make your works easy. I harnessed the power of automation to combine tables with hundreds of rows with the same ID. It took me minutes to write this script but I can reuse part of the code with a few changes such as file path. Works that require hours of manual labour now take seconds to cmoplete.

### Let me know if there is something I can doo better.
